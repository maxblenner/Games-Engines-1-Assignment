My game is a randomly generated map/terrain using Perlin noise, it has a seed system allowing you to change the terrain generation on the fly (in the editor). 
It allows player movement, floating over the terrain to view the generation. 

I used some knowledge from the labs/lectures along with help from Sebastian Lague's videos related to Perlin Noise map generation to help me with the editor functionality https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ

I am most proud of achiving the different colours based on terrain height, to simulate textures. 

The video included below is a demonstration of the game in action. It starts with me editing options on the map generator script to demonstrate the change in the terrain.
I then start up the game and move around, cycling through different seeds (generations of terrain)
Video of game running: [!The Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhPOgrO7DsQ&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=Spookyman)

To replicate what is seen in the video:
- Open the map generator object to play with the perlin noise generation settings
- Hit play on the game (WASD to move and mouse to look)
